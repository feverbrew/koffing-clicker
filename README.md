# koffing-clicker
A website inspired by Cookie Clicker

My website is being hosted on [Netlify!](https://pensive-villani-99990e.netlify.app/)

## Intentions
I began this project as a way to learn and improve my JavaScript skills. I knew little to no JS before starting this project.
This project was inspired by [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/), one of my favorite websites on the internet, and Pokemon, one of my favorite franchises.

## Current Features
- Click Koffing to manually collect gas.
- Buy buildings to idly collect gas.
- Buy upgrades to make gas collection faster.
- Settings menu with save data management.
- Evolutions!

## Future Plans
- "Story": have some kind of plotline in the game that progresses as you click.
- Generation Sprite Options: Allow you to choose which gen Koffings and friends you want to see.
- Other forms :eyes:
- More UI, ability to see achievements and upgrades you've unlocked.
- More upgrades and buildings

bla blah
